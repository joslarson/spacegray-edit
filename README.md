==============

Packaged Chrome App that assists in making simple color customized versions of the Spacegray Sublime Text theme.

## TODO

[ ] Add ability to load syntax themes
[ ]


## IDEAS

* Global color pallet that elements can be set to inherit from, but then can be extended with opacity, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast percentage modifications
* Maybe global colors can inherit from each other?? Makes modifying ui colors to match syntax background in one step
